<h2>First, a bit of history...</h2>
<p>
    Before we dive into the latest winners and unforgettable moments, let's take a step back and see how the Grammys became the most prestigious award in music. Here are some key milestones in Grammy history:

    <div class="events">
        <div class="events-header">
         <h4>1950s - The origins</h4>
        </div>
            <p>The Recording Academy (formally the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences; NARAS) was created in 1957, when The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce requested a list of people in the music industry that should be awarded a star on the Walk of Fame.
            <br>
            <br>
            As not every artist deserved a star, but still deserved recognition for their contribution in the recording field, they decided to rectify this by giving their own awards.
            <br>
            <br>
            The name ‚ÄúGrammy‚Äù was voted, named after the Gramophone, the early record player.
            </p>
        <div class="events-header">
        <h4> 1959 - The First Ceremony</h4>
        </div>
            <div class="photoevent">
                <p>
                The Academy presented the first Grammy Award on the 4th of May 1959.
                <br>
                <br>
                The ceremony was held in Los Angeles and in New York simultaneously. Only 28 awards were distributed that evening compare to 90+ today.
                <br>
                <br>
                Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nat King Cole were among the first winners.

        <div class="events-header">
        <h4>1960s - 1970s -The Evolution of Genres</h4>
        </div>
            <p>
            In the 1960s, new categories were introduced to reflect the evolving music landscape.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, it wasn't until 1979 that the Rock category was added, following pressure from the music industry.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Grammys also faced criticism for being slow to acknowledge hip-hop and R&amp;B, with these genres only receiving dedicated awards in the late 1980s.
            </p>
        <div class="events-header">
        <h4>1971 - The 1st Televised Grammy Awards</h4>
        </div>

                <p>
                The 13th Annual Grammy Award were for the first time broadcast on TV on the 16th of March 1971.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, the excitement of the Grammys could be enjoyed by viewers in real time.

        <h4>2000 - The creation of the Latin Grammys</h4>
        </div>
            <div class="photoevent">
                <p>
                In 1997, the Latin Recording Academy was founded as the Latin music industry kept growing bigger and needed its own ceremony independent of the Grammy Awards.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the 13th of September 2000 was held the first ever annual Latin Grammys ceremony, in Los Angeles.

                The ceremony remains the biggest night in music, and features performances from the top artists. The awards generates a lot of media attention, with over 15 millions people watching the ceremony.
                <br>
                <br>
