<h2>First, a bit of history...</h2>
<p>
    Before we dive into the latest winners and unforgettable moments, let's take a step back and see how the Grammys became the most prestigious award in music. Here are some key milestones in Grammy history:

         <h4>1950s - The origins</h4>
        </div>
            <p>The Recording Academy (formally the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences; NARAS) was created in 1957, when The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce requested a list of people in the music industry that should be awarded a star on the Walk of Fame.
            <br>
            <br>
            As not every artirst deserved a star, but still deserved recognition for their contribution in the recording field, they decided to rectify this by giving their own awards.
            <br>
            <br>
            The name “Grammy” was voted, named after the Gramophone, the early record player.
            </p>

        <h4> 1959 - The First Ceremony</h4>
        </div>
            <div class="photoevent">
                <p>
                The Academy presented the first Grammy Award on the 4th of May 1959. The ceremony was held in Los Angeles and in New York simultanously. Only 28 awards were distributed that evening compare to 90+ today.
                <br>
                <br>
                Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nat King Cole were among the first winners.

        <h4>1960s - 1970s -The Evolution of Genres</h4>
        </div>
            <p>
            In the 1960s, new categories were introduced to reflect the evolving music landscape. However, it wasn't until 1979 that the Rock category was added, following pressure from the music industry. The Grammys also faced criticism for being slow to acknowledge hip-hop and R&amp;B, with these genres only receiving dedicated awards in the late 1980s.
            </p>
